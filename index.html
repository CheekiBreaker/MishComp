                    In an increasingly disconnected world, spaces of true connection and presence are rare. The Beyond
                    exists to create, nurture and protect these spaces. We’re here to challenge conventional ideas and
                    to
                    explore deeper truths. The Beyond is more than a festival... It’s a community in which those who
                    have
                    always felt there was something more, something beyond, connect to find purpose, meaning and magic.
